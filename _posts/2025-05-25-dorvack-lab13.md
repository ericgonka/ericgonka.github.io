## 1. Offensive Security Exam Penetration Test Report

### 1.1 Introduction
The Offensive Security Exam penetration test report outlines all actions and efforts taken during the Offensive Security exam. This report is graded based on the thoroughness, accuracy, and completion of each aspect of the exam. It ensures the student demonstrates an in-depth understanding of penetration testing methodologies as well as the technical knowledge required to earn the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification.

### 1.2 Objective
The objective is to perform an internal penetration test on the Offensive Security Exam network. The student must follow a systematic approach to achieving the assigned goals. This test simulates an actual penetration test, from start to finish, and includes a comprehensive report.

### 1.3 Requirements
The student is required to fill out this report fully, including the following sections:
- High-level summary and recommendations (non-technical)
- Detailed methodology outline
- Each finding with screenshots, walkthroughs, sample code, and proof.txt if applicable
- Additional items if not included in previous sections

---

## 2. High-Level Summary

### Compromised Hosts
- **192.168.1.123 (Dorvack-Files)** – Dorvack-Files Web
---

### 2.1 Recommendations
It is recommended that the identified vulnerabilities be patched immediately to prevent exploitation. These systems require regular updates and patches to avoid future breaches.

---

## 3. Methodologies

### 3.1 Information Gathering
Information gathering is critical in penetration testing. In this case, the scope of the test covered the following IP addresses:
- `192.168.1.123`

---

### 3.2 Penetration

#### System IP: `172.20.0.235` 
#### Intranet Dorvack-Files IP: `192.168.1.123`

**Service Enumeration:**
- **Dorvack-Files IP Address:** 192.168.1.123

| Protocol | Port(s)       |
|----------|---------------|
| TCP      | 80, 3306      |
| UDP      |               |

- **Nmap Scan Results:**

We set up a script since the victim machine doesn't have Nmap to see the internal IPs and common ports that are open.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b94af3c6-d6af-42ff-8346-f751c448bc62)

We run the script and see several IPs with open ports, but we are particularly drawn to `192.168.1.1`, the Router **(PFSense)**, which we see has the `SSH` and `HTTP` services open.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b207b2d-9316-4839-99a3-84ab4b8d0a9b)

We are going to create a dynamic tunnel with `SSH` to be able to reach the router from the attacking machine, and thus have connectivity with `192.168.1.1`.
We can log in with the root user by changing the password, or use the user as I did, since in the previous lab we found a file with the password `user01`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/278c4c39-57f8-43f0-930b-dc7c3a772dcd)

We configure the `SOCKS PROXY` in burp suite to be able to reach the router thanks to the tunnel we have created via `ssh`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7df7c61-0d9c-4ecd-b2ef-a810a57c3c43)

We configure the `FoxyProxy` extension in the browser to point to the `BurpSuite proxy`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09348bde-5b4f-4a7d-b6ce-8783b86a04e2)

We access the router's IP through the browser and see that we have access and it is indeed a `PFSense`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/744a1e4d-7a65-4d67-9567-d8429fa04644)

We searched with searchsploit and tried several scripts that were ineffective, although one particularly caught my attention.

##### Initial Shell Vulnerability Exploited  

- _pfSense <= 2.3.1_1 Post-Auth Command Execution_  
- **Vulnerability Explanation:**  
  _pfSense <= 2.3.1_1 is affected by a post-authetication os command injection vulnerability in auth.inc via the /system_groupmanager.php page (System menu-->User Manager-->Groups) in the handling of the members[] parameter.  This allows an authenticated WebGUI user with privileges for system_groupmanager.php to execute commands in the context of the root user._  
- **Vulnerability Fix:**  
  _Upgrade to the latest version of pfSense (2.3.1_5 on is fixed). This may be performed in the web interface or from the console.  See https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Upgrade_Guide  Furthermore, the issues can be mitigated by restricting access to the firewall GUI both with firewall rules and by not allowing untrusted users to have accounts with GUI access, and by not granting untrusted administrators access to the pages in question._  
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Proof of Concept Code:**
  
```bash
'`ifconfig>/usr/local/www/ifconfig.txt`'
'`whoami>/usr/local/www/whoami.txt`'
 ```

Previously we accessed the router with the user `Carlos` and the password we found in the previous lab.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63c3bf9a-5711-41a4-8475-ebbc4e447f99)

Once inside we modify the URL to `system_groupmanager.php` which is where the vulnerability is located.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5131f70c-b428-425e-8fa6-ae3e68349396)

We make some modifications to the group and when saving we capture the request with `BurpSuite`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68df4490-0cd4-4793-8657-3006cfcc267d)

Once intercepted, we modify the members parameter to inject the whoami command and store the result in the `whoami.txt` file.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed985b99-f43d-4dea-a13b-10b12aa6ea6a)

We see that it actually works and we have remote command execution.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c03f6b01-25b6-411c-9c7c-859a4560f011)

We try another command such as `ifconfig`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4bb07e4-c994-40e7-8f88-b1125814c6a4)

This is where the problem really arises, as trying the usual reverse shells didn't give me any results.
On the PentestMonkey website, I found an untested reverse shell that worked on most systems. I modified it, encoded it in URL format, and ran it.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7bc6ad2-89b8-4c93-98c5-b848c3ddba39)

And yes, that worked for me and I got access to the router as root, since that is the user that runs the website, we verified it with the whoami above.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8366f893-350a-42b6-ad68-fd890967f7b9)

We go to Carlos's home and read the flag.

**flag.txt Contents:**

```
flag{C4r105FaeDFF42aD680}
```

Finally, we added the user Carlos to the administrators group to access the website's administration panel.
